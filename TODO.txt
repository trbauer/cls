CONCEPTS:
* We'd like to override buffer attributes with print arguments
  let A = 0:w
  ...
  ...<...>(A:p8, ...)

* Emitting a dataflow graph in dot or svg format

* Device check and emit SASS and GEN ISA

* Emitting cpp code instead of running it

* Caching read-only inputs for surface objects
  If it's read-only, don't re-initialize in successive runs

* Debugging
  Modify source to take a status buffer, and bounds on buffers and doing bounds checking
  Could support SPIR-V and PTX injection.

* Emit MDAPI counters.  CL Intercept is nice, but it's always a pain to setup and run.

* Kernel argument folding (SPIR-V/PTX modification)
   file.cl`kernel<512x512!,8x8!>(0:w,1:r,1024!)

* Reductions and Branching
   if (all(A,\x -> gcd(10,x) == 1))
     ...

* Run graphs optimally

* Generic print
   print(#0)

* Printing diffing floating point element should use maximal precision in printing or print hex values

TODO:
* FEATURE:
   - parser context help
     if problem in memattr
      ..:rX...
          ^
      try -h=syntax:meminit

* TEST:
   - kargs.cpp OpenCL C parsing error (does the diagnostic make sense?)
* FEATURE:
   - buffer slicing and reducing
      foo[:24] up to 24
      foo[24] is 24
      foo[24:] is 24 and on
* FEATURE:
   - parsing structures from C
   - add tests for structs
* FEATURE
   - add tests/spirv.spv as a test
* FEATURE
   - pass immediate samplers from inits

* CLEANUP:
   - get rid of FATAL macro
   - get rid of logging in sys
   - collapse os.debug() into using diagnostics()
   - merge string prefix/suffix stuff into text.hpp from system.hpp
   - search TODO's to find stuff to delete
   - search #if 0's to find dead code

* FEATURE
   - improve SPIR-V parsing
      * forward ref pointers
      * enums
      * generic pointers (CL 2.0)

* CONSIDER:
   - types.hpp: splitting vector types out of structure types to
     simplify the constexpr stuff; this more clearly shows structures
     as user-defined types and vectors as special creatures.

   - in tandem with this, prefer OpenCL C vector construction syntax
       (float4)3.14f or (float4)(...)
     consider

* TEST:
   images loaded into a buffer?
   does that work? e.g. uchar4...

* demo an explict buffer size with a complex.cl example
* demo struct types with float2 in a complex example

* FEATURE
   flush and finish on context
   #0:A:finish
   #0:A:flush
   or flush(#0), finish(#0), finish(#0:A)


* FEATURE
    - image diff
      diff(I1,I2)
        emits difference image?

* redesign let expressions
    - permit bindings of more than surfaces and dispatches

    - get rid of context identifiers
        two programs from the same context
          def A=#0, B=#0 // replaces #0:A..., #0:B
          A`prog1.cl`kernel<32>(...)
          def P=A`prog1.cl[opts]
          P`kernel<32>(...)
          def K1=P`kernel
          def K2=P`kernel
          def K3=P`kernel<32x32>(...)

        two distinct kernels from the same program
          let P=#0`prog1.cl
          P`kernel1...
          P`kernel2...
        same kernel, but different instances
          let P=#0`prog1.cl
          P`kernel<...>  different kernel instances
          P`kernel<...> different instances
        calling the same kernel instance twice
          let K=#0`file.cl`kernel
          K<...>() // set args; call
          K<...>() // set args; call

   functions?
      def D(X)=statement; statements...
      D(A); D(B)


* BUG
  let A=0:rw
  let B=0:rw
  #0`demo2.cl`div<8>(A)
  #1`demo2.cl`div<8>(B)
  print<uint>(A); print(A)
  print<uint>(B)
  print(B)
  diff(A,B)

* ENABLE SPIR-V: clCreateProgramWithIL
  https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/2.1/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateProgramWithIL.html
   PROBLEM? arg info???

* STUDY: how to use events?
   E.g. A->B and C->D run in parallel
* ENABLE:
   change instance syntax to
     #0#a to #0:a

* ENABLE: transfer behavior
   :c and :m

* ENABLE: make dispatches asynchronous (save the event?)
    #0`prog.cl`foo...
    #0`prog.cl`foo...
    #0`prog.cl`foo...
    #0`prog.cl`foo...
  no ramp up/down

* Build in Linux

* ENABLE SVM (add sa)
   dynamically bind to clSVM
* ENABLE max error diff
    diff<float,0.001>(...)
  (requires special handling of half/float/double buffers)

* ENABLE proper nan compare
   - first make a test case that fails today
   - then fix NaN bits may differ between different platforms, but we desire
    any sNAN and qNAN to compare properly (drop payloads)

* CONSIDER "as" bindings;
   ...`foo<...>(I@...)
   save(I)


* SPECIFY: how to create images such that we can enable 2D/3D/LOD etc...
  https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.2/docs/man/xhtml/cl_image_desc.html

* BUG
    diff<int*>(A,B); where A and B come from contexts from devices with different ptr sizes
  NOTE: should be rare since (int*) would require SVM

* BUG
  let A=0:[4*8*2]w
  #2`tests/add.cl[-DT=int2]`add<8>(A,{1,2})

* allow k, m suffixes on dimensions (4k or 4 k) (1k x 1k)
   lexically will show up as ident
* remove cl.hpp deps: cl::Kernel cl::Device

* enable different timing units -u=s -u=us -u=ms

* CONSIDER define and implement global buffer reductions (min, max)
   reduce<min>(A)
   reduce<max>(A)
   reduce<sum>(A)
   reduce<avg>(A)
  NO => write a kernel to do it

* CONSIDER

cls: help syntax system would be good to emit and keep in sync with all work
  -h=#0

------------------------
PROBLEMS:
* partial applicaiton kernels are incoherent since arguments are
  associated with OpenCL kernel objects
    let K = prog.cl`kernel
    K<1024>(0:w,1);
    K<1024>(1:w,2);
  creates two dispatches with the same kernel object
  the surface objects and scalar arguments are ambiguous

cls: default program   #1`kernel<1024x1024,16x16>(...)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////
DONE
* support explicit dimensions
cls: where
    ...foo<>(...) where A = ...
cls: rename -L to -l
cls: enable device index on -l (or -L)
cls: disable arguments starting with - since we absorb bad options that way...

* BUG: let X=0:[128]wp4 appears as let spec
* BUG: print(...) before buffer use; crashes (nullptr surface_object*)
* test static and dynamic SLM
* test buffers of structures
cls: per dispatch samplers (timing)
  using per_dispatch_samples = std::vector<std::tuple<const cls::dispatch_spec *,sampler_t>>;
  per_dispatch_samples compiled_script::get_per_dispatch_samples();

cls: enable ndr device selection syntax #1`foo.cl and #GTX`...

cls: -tH -tCL dumps times of every call in a table
   example (with -i=16)
                 ....                      time (s)    cfv       min (s)     max (s)
   #0`./foo`kernel1<1024>(0:w,1:r)        0.002310 +- 2.2%      0.002251    0.002421
   #0`./foo`kernel2<1024>(0:w,1:r)        0.005151 +- 0.6%      0.005251    0.006421

   OPEN: do we affix the device we selected to the syntax unconditionally?
